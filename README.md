Benchmarks Demo
===============

###Description
A demo that had to be put together in about 3 days; uses node.js. It's __incomplete__ due to time constraints. I did not have time for debugging, testing, backbone.js, or a custom CSS framework which was part of the original plan and was cut short.

###Tech
* Node.js (https://github.com/joyent/node)
* Express (https://github.com/visionmedia/express)
* MongoDB (http://www.mongodb.org/)
* Mongoose (https://github.com/LearnBoost/mongoose)
* Jade (https://github.com/visionmedia/jade)
* Flat UI (https://github.com/designmodo/Flat-UI)

###Usage
Please do not use this code as it is incomplete and not production ready. If you download and implement this it is without warranty. I will not give support or anything related. If you have questions or suggestions about the _code_ feel free to email me at mikebarnhardt@gmail.com
